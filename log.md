# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## 180629 - Day 0

### Today's Progress

Learned about 100 Days of Code (Thanks, Santo!) and began planning and setting up my environment.

### Thoughts

Excited to be doing this with my new friends Santo and Tim! Looking forward to building more of a developer mindset and improving my skills in data-processing languages (SQL, Python, R) and the methodologies that go along with them.
